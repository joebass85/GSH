This is a graphical front-end to the openSSH protocol.
GSH seeks to provide an easy-to-use graphical user interface for openSSH.
GSH must be run from the terminal, inside the gsh/ directory, using the command (without quotes):
"python3 gsh.py".
At this time, this is the only way to run the command. You must additionally provide a password, if necessary.
