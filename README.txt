This is a graphical front-end to the openSSH protocol.
GSH seeks to provide an easy-to-use graphical user interface for openSSH.

You must provide a password in the terminal, if necessary according to your ssh config.

This program depends on the subprocess and time modules from the Python Standard Library.
This program also depends on the Tkinter module and the pyautogui module.
Tkinter can be install from your distrobution's repos.
Pyautogui must be installed with the pip3 installer (pip3 install pyautogui)

GSH can be run from the terminal with the command (no quotes) "python3 gsh.py"
or it can be run from a keybinding.
